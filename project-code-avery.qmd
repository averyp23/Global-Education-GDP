## The Question

. . .

How is the percentage of a countryâ€™s GDP Services and Literacy Rate Correlated?


- A correlation could show a pattern in the relationship between GDP and Education Statistics

- The economic state of a country could influence the education standards of the country, hence why we're comparing these two variables 

## The Variables 

. . . 

Education: Literacy Rate of Females Across the World  

. . . 

- The number indicates the percentage of women who are literate in the respective country 

. . . 

GDP: Percentage of Services that make up GDP   

. . .

- The number indicates the percentage of GDP that is made up of services in the respective country 

. . .

- The GDP Data from the original database was split into Industry, Manufacturing and Services

## Results

```{r}  
#| include: true
ggplot(all_data, aes(x = LR_F, y = GDP_2022_SE, color = GDP_2022_SE)) + 
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +
  # geom_text(aes(label = `Countries and Areas`))+
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", color = "black") +
  guides(color = "none") +
  scale_color_gradient(low = "red", high = "blue") +
  theme_light() + 
  labs(x = "Literacy Rate for Women", y= "Percentage of GDP-Services") +
  labs(title = "Countries with a GDP-S above 45% have a high Literacy Rate for Women") + 
  theme_light(base_size = 16)
```
## Conclusion 

. . .

The results indicate a positive correlation between a high literacy rate and GDP of services in 2022

. . . 

- More research may need to be conducted to analyze the statistics further and identify outlines 

. . .

- The way a countries GDP is invested could potentially affect the educational standards, access, and data in a country
